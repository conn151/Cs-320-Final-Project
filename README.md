1) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  I can ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure by conducting the proper test procedures for each category needed. 
  
 2) How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  
    I can interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by taking it one step at a time. I feel that if I take things one step at a time as I incorporate the code, it will help ensure I take everything.
    
 3) How do I approach designing software?
      
      I approach designing software by taking it step by step. I do not take the whole project and try to do it all, I will take each portion of the work, and work on it one step at a time to ensure it is efficient and correct work.
